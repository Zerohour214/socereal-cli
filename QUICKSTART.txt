Install and run the SOCereal CLI with these steps on Windows:

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run `install.bat` from this folder to build `socereal.exe`.
3. After installation, call the tool with `socereal <images> -o output.csv`.

The installer uses Python and pip, so ensure Python 3.8+ is installed from
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ .
